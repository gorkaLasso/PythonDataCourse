## Part 1 - Plotting Coronavirus Data
Feel free to use the updated JHU data [here](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases). You can access this notebook by navigating to the notebook and right-clicking `Raw` > `Download linked file` and saving the extension as .ipynb

## Part 2 - Create a github account and push your jupyter notebook
Here is a link to get you started [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join). Don't forget to download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)! Message us over slack once you are done =)

If you are ambitious, you can clone this repository `PythonDataCourse`. You can fetch/pull this regularly and everything added here will magically appear on your local computer. You'll notice that Columbia-Nueropythonistas has two repositories, one for the course website `course-website` and one for lecture notes, homeworks and code `PythonDataCourse`

## Part 3 (Bonus) - Create a personal webpage on github using GitHub Pages and Jekyll
Feel free to start with these links:  [https://guides.github.com/features/pages/](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) and [https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/online-cv](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/online-cv)
